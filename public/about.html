<h1>Hi I'm Jack</h1>
<p>I'm a current student at BHS interested in the field of computer science and computer engineering. I'm currently learning more about web development as it's something that everybody starts off with when persuing interest in CS. Over the past year, I have worked on game development and I'm currently trying to develop a core curriculm to provide education on producing games. I'm currently also the co-president for my FTC Robotics team.</p>

<h2>What I Know.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>C: The language that everybody starts off in CS50</li>
  <li>C#: NOT THE SAME AS C; Useful for Unity and making small games</li>
  <li>Java: Primary language for AP CSA, honestly haven't done much with this language yet besides in-school projects</li>
  <li>Python: Great language for coding competitions; straight forward with no bullshit syntax</li>
  <li>HTML: What this website is composed of!</li>
</ul>
